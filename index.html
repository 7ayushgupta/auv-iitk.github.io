                        <p>We have been finally able to implement SIFT in Opencv 3.0.0. Now have tested it with few samples of images we had underwater so now we shall go for a sample collection in daylight to test our algorithm and implement it on a frame by frame basis and inculcate it in ROS Framework</p>
