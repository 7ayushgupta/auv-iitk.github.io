  text : ESSO-National Institute of Technology (NIOT) , under the Ministry of Earth Sciences, is organize a competition for students pursuing engineering degree to visualize and design an autonomous underwater vehicle.The conceptual basis for Student Autonomous underwater Vehicle (SAVe), is a highly mobile Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to be built based on engineering principles. The main focus of this competition is to involve students on the new frontier areas of ocean technology and    kindle their innovative thinking in this unexplored area of ocean environment and observation. NIOT will support the winning team with their technical expertise and also sponsor for the International competition being held annually in AUVSI foundation San Diego, USA.The competition is open to Indian national students only.
        To provide opportunities for students to experience the underwater technologies of system engineering.
        To develop skills in AUV engineering technologies
        To provide a learning basement for students with an interest in international AUV competitions
